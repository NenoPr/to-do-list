To Do List for The Odin Project

Commit 1: Finished creating objects and their relations, added logic for creating new tasks and projects on the DOM and connected them for writing and recalling them with the data the objects

Commit 2: Redesigned the to do task into a column list, clicking it expands description. Added multiple project support and its creation logic and interface. Added new task creation logic and interface design.Added date input to task with the current day based on the date from the date-fn module. Added Priority.Added ability to edit,check and delete a task.Editing prompts a window with all of the tasks info already inputted and ready to be changed.Added basic sidebar logic based on its implied action still a work in progress. Added the ability to sort by priority and date, ascending and descending. Some more design changes and that's mostly all I can add

Commit 3: Completed all of the project requirements. Added sort by by creation date. Added ability to edit project name and delete it. Added the ability to change the tasks project location in the add task and edit task. Added the displaying of the current display scope like Project,Inbox,Today,This Week, This month etc.. Finished implementing the sidebar logic and it's implied actions. Fixed the sorting code so it works based on the displayed nodes rather that following the current Display scope, it simplified it and its good enough for this project's scale. Fixed the deletion of the tasks where it would delete the wrong task, problem with array indexing. Implemented localStorage so that data persists on the local computer up to 5MB. Did some minor design changes. Maybe I skipped something but the project is basically complete.
